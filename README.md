### Remarks to test our App:

All remarks are additionally commented in the corresponding test file.
* Please enable developer settings
* Set this App as Mock Location Provider: Systems -> Advanced -> Developer Options -> Debugging -> Select Mock Location App 
* Set it to None afterwards for a correct behavior of the App

* For the PermissionHandlingInstrumentedTest:
    * All permissions except the LOCATION, have to be granted.
    * The tests have to be run in alphabetical order.
    * properly not working on Android 30

### Known Limitations for Release 1:

* On the real device the LanguageIntegrationTests are failing. But the App shows the correct selected language, also on the real device. So the tests are failing but the Apps language behaviour is correct. (In the Simulator everything works correct.)
* This issue will be handled in the next Release.
